# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working in this repository.

## Project Overview

**SeaSloth** is a one-time performance snapshot for parts of the CROC ocean modeling
ecosystem that don't change commit-to-commit: xESMF/ESMF regridding (external libraries),
the mom6_forge bathymetry pipeline, and the CrocoDash OBC regrid+merge pipeline. It uses
[pytest-benchmark](https://pytest-benchmark.readthedocs.io/) and renders two static HTML
pages — a heatmap and a line chart (plain inline HTML/CSS/SVG, no charting library) plus
detail tables, no hand-written narrative.

Commit-by-commit performance tracking for CrocoDash/mom6_forge code lives in those repos'
own pytest-benchmark suites — not here. SeaSloth previously used ASV (airspeed velocity)
for commit tracking; that's gone.

## What is being benchmarked

| Suite | File(s) | Data needed | What it measures |
|---|---|---|---|
| xESMF weight generation | `xesmf/test_weights_generate.py` | None (synthetic) | `xe.Regridder()` construction time + RSS |
| xESMF regrid application | `xesmf/test_regrid_apply.py` | None (synthetic) | `regridder(ds)` time across grid sizes, time depths, methods |
| ESMF weight generation | `esmf/test_weights_generate.py` | None (synthetic) | raw `esmpy.Regrid()` construction — same sizes as xESMF |
| ESMF regrid application | `esmf/test_regrid_apply.py` | None (synthetic) | raw `esmpy.Regrid()(src, dst)` time |
| Bathymetry pipeline | `mom6_forge/test_topo.py` | GEBCO (GLADE) | `Topo.set_from_dataset()` — GEBCO regrid + fill across domain sizes |
| OBC forcing pipeline | `crocodash/test_obc.py` | Cached GLORYS (GLADE) | REGRID + MERGE of `process_obc_conditions()`, varying `regrid_step` |

Data-source health (link/`validate_function` checks) is a **separate**, daily-run concern —
see `scripts/check_data_access.py` below, not part of the pytest-benchmark suite.

## Framework: pytest-benchmark

Every benchmark is a normal pytest test using the `benchmark` fixture. `pytest.mark.parametrize`
replaces ASV's `params`/`param_names`; `@pytest.mark.skipif` replaces ASV's
`raise NotImplementedError` in `setup()` for data-dependent tests.

Key conventions:
- `benchmark(fn)` — times `fn`, calibrating reps automatically. Use for cheap, synthetic benchmarks.
- `benchmark.pedantic(fn, rounds=1, iterations=1, warmup_rounds=0)` — times `fn` exactly
  once. Use for expensive/data-dependent benchmarks (GEBCO regrid, GLORYS regrid+merge,
  network calls) where repeating the call for statistical calibration would be wasteful or slow.
- `benchmark.extra_info["rss_mb"] = ...` — memory tracking, since pytest-benchmark has no
  built-in memory measurement. See `benchmarks/common/memtrack.py`.
- `pytest.mark.light` / `pytest.mark.heavy` — the smallest parameter combination in a
  synthetic (xESMF/ESMF) sweep is tagged `light` for a fast smoke test; everything else is
  `heavy`. `test_topo.py` and `test_obc.py` are always `heavy` — even their smallest size
  needs real GEBCO/GLORYS data and takes meaningful time. Run just the light ones with
  `pytest -m light`.

## Running Benchmarks

```bash
conda activate CrocoDash

bash scripts/run_benchmarks.sh                # all perf benchmarks -> results/latest.json
bash scripts/run_benchmarks.sh -m light       # fast smoke test (synthetic suites only)
bash scripts/run_benchmarks.sh -k xesmf       # one suite

python scripts/generate_report.py             # -> report/index.html

# On Derecho — PBS job for the full suite (needs GEBCO/GLORYS data)
qsub scripts/pbs_submit.sh
```

Data access health runs separately, daily — via `.github/workflows/publish.yml`'s
`data-health` job (inside the `crocontainer` image, which has `CrocoDash` pre-installed).
Run it by hand the same way locally:

```bash
python scripts/check_data_access.py           # -> results/health.json
python scripts/generate_health_report.py      # -> report/health.html
```

## data_config.json

Keys that need to be set before HPC-dependent benchmarks will run:

| Key | Used by | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `gebco_path` | `test_topo.py` | Path to GEBCO_2024.nc |
| `obc_hgrid_path` / `obc_bathymetry_path` / `obc_vgrid_path` | `test_obc.py` | Grid + bathymetry from an existing CrocoDash case |
| `obc_raw_data_dir` | `test_obc.py` | Directory of pre-downloaded GLORYS OBC files, one per boundary, named `{boundary}_unprocessed.{start}_{end}.nc` with ISO dates |
| `obc_dates_start` / `obc_dates_end` | `test_obc.py` | Date range those raw files cover |

Tests using these paths skip via `pytest.mark.skipif`/`pytest.skip()` when the path is unset
or missing.

## Memory Benchmarks

Use `benchmarks/common/memtrack.py`'s `measure_rss(fn, *args, **kwargs)` — not ASV's
`track_rss_mb` convention. It returns `(result, rss_delta_mb)`; stash the delta into
`benchmark.extra_info["rss_mb"]`. This exists because ESMF performs large C/Fortran heap
allocations invisible to Python's `sys.getsizeof`/`tracemalloc`.

## Synthetic Data

Use helpers from `benchmarks/common/synthetic_data.py` — do not create grids inline.

| Function | Returns | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `make_rect_grid(nlon, nlat)` | 1D lon/lat xr.Dataset with bounds | xESMF source |
| `make_curvilinear_grid(nlon, nlat)` | 2D lon/lat xr.Dataset with bounds | xESMF destination |
| `make_locstream_grid(n)` | 1D ncells xr.Dataset | OBC boundary (locstream_out=True) |
| `make_data_variable(grid, ntime, nvars)` | grid + data variables | Anything needing data to regrid |

For ESMF direct benchmarks use `_make_esmpy_grid(nlon, nlat)` defined inline in the
benchmark file — not the xarray helpers.

## Report generators

Both are plain stdlib (`json` + f-strings) — no matplotlib, no numpy, no image generation.
`scripts/generate_report.py` groups `results/latest.json`'s benchmarks by suite (parsed from
`fullname`) then by test function. The six xESMF/ESMF weight-generation/apply benchmarks are
consolidated into one heatmap section (source size × destination size → time, inline HTML
table + a shared log-scale color legend, sequential-blue ramp from the dataviz palette) —
no separate detail tables for those two suites, the heatmap is the whole story. `test_topo`
(mom6_forge) gets a small inline-SVG line chart (domain size → time, log-scale y-axis,
direct value labels) since it's a natural sweep. Everything else, plus `test_topo`/`test_obc`
themselves, still gets a plain table (params, mean, min, max, rss). `scripts/generate_health_report.py`
renders `results/health.json`'s `link_checks`/`validate_checks` lists as two small tables.
Neither computes cross-benchmark ratios or writes prose — if you're tempted to add narrative
back in, don't; that's the complexity this rewrite removed.

## CI

`.github/workflows/publish.yml` triggers on push to `main`, `workflow_dispatch`, and a daily
`schedule`.

- **`data-health`** (schedule + manual dispatch only): runs inside the
  [`crocontainer`](https://github.com/CROCODILE-CESM/crocontainer) image on GitHub-hosted
  `ubuntu-latest` — that image already has the `CrocoDash` conda env built in (see its
  `Dockerfile`/`environment.yml`), so `scripts/check_data_access.py` can really import
  `CrocoDash` and call `ProductRegistry.validate_function()` for real, not just skip
  gracefully. It commits and pushes the refreshed `results/health.json`. Checks that read
  hardcoded `/glade/...` paths (GLORYS via RDA, CESM ocean output) always report unhealthy
  from CI — that's expected, they're GLADE-only by design. Checks needing Copernicus
  Marine/CDS credentials need `COPERNICUSMARINE_SERVICE_USERNAME`/`_PASSWORD` and
  `CDSAPI_URL`/`CDSAPI_KEY` set as repo secrets to pass.
- **`publish`** (always runs): regenerates both report pages from whatever is currently
  committed under `results/` and deploys to GitHub Pages. It never runs the perf
  benchmarks — those need real HPC-scale GEBCO/GLORYS data and stay a manual/PBS thing.
