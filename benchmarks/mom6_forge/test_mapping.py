Benchmarks: gen_rof_maps() (mom6_forge) — GLOFAS runoff -> ocean mapping files.

gen_rof_maps() builds the two mapping files CESM's DROF component needs to move
river discharge onto the ocean grid: a nearest-neighbor map (`_nn.nc`) and a
smoothed nearest-neighbor map (`_nnsm.nc`). Both sweeps here run against the
production ROF mesh — the one CIME actually registers as `ROF_DOMAIN_MESH`,
21.6M elements — because that is the only source mesh a real case ever uses.

Two sweeps, because destination cost has two independent axes:

  - **Ocean domain extent** (`test_gen_rof_maps_domain`) grows the destination
    cell count and the source/destination overlap window together, which is how
    a real case grows. The ladder starts far below any real configuration (a 1
    degree box, 144 cells) and steps up ~4x at a time, so the shape of the curve
    is visible well before the domains get expensive; once the rungs reach
    real-case scale they become the actual configurations CROC builds — Gulf of
    Mexico, Caribbean, North Atlantic, and an Indo-Pacific domain sized to the
    existing `CrocIndoPacific_112` case. Cost is flat to ~116K cells and then
    rises mildly: 2.4M cells costs ~2.4x the 144-cell case, not orders more.
  - **Ocean resolution** (`test_gen_rof_maps_resolution`) grows the destination
    cell count at a *fixed* geographic footprint, so the overlap window and the
    set of contributing rivers stay constant. Separating this from extent is the
    point: it isolates destination-grid cost from "how much of the world does
    this domain touch".

Requires the production ROF mesh at the path in data_config.json
(`rof_esmf_mesh_global_path`). GLADE only — skipped gracefully elsewhere.

Also requires a mom6_forge that has the runoff-mapping write-path fix (see
`_has_write_path_fix` below). Run this suite in the `mom6_forge` conda env, not
`CrocoDash` — CrocoDash's nested mom6_forge checkout is a different branch and
does not have the fix.

Keep every box clear of the 0/360 seam — the assertion below enforces it. This
sweep originally reported the two basin-scale rungs as intractable (>1 hr, no
completion), which was wrong: the `north_atlantic` box was `(280.0, 80.0, ...)`
and 280 + 80 = 360. `_get_mesh_bbox()` normalizes longitudes into [0, 360), so a
node at exactly 360 becomes 0 and the naive min/max returns a *near-global*
longitude bbox (0.0 .. 359.92) instead of 280 .. 360. That makes
`generate_ESMF_map_via_xesmf`'s `map_overlap` masking a no-op in longitude, so
the regrid runs against the whole global latitude band instead of the domain's
own window. Shifted 5 degrees west, the identical 576K-cell case finishes in
106 s. Fixed in mom6_forge PR #125, where _lon_bbox()/_lon_outside() make the
bbox and its membership test wrap-aware; the boxes here stay off-seam so this
ladder's numbers remain comparable, and because the failure is silent against an
older mom6_forge.
